## Cybersecurity Policy Implementation Plan for "NexusTech"

As the CISO/GRC Specialist tasked with creating a new cybersecurity policy for NexusTech, I want to create a comprehensive policy that can be implemented in phases to protect company digital assets, maintain regulatory compliance with key industry standards such as ISO 27001, NIST, and GDPR, and ensure business continuity. This policy targets key threats such as phishing, ransomware, insider threats, unauthorized access, and advanced AI-related threats such as deepfakes and vishing. 

Note: NexusTech already uses many of Microsoft Azure's core platforms.

#### Foreword

Below, I have outlined the key frameworks and playbooks that NexusTech should adhere to. While they may appear straightforward, they are designed for ease of implementation and when followed, they will strengthen our security posture and reduce risk across the organization. 

#### A. 5-Step Key Process of the KTS Cybersecurity Policy

**I. Identity and Access Management:**

As a core user of numerous Azure services, our company will enforce role-based access control (RBAC) using Azure Active Directory. NexusTech will also implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts and privileged roles using multiple services including Microsoft Authenticator. NexusTech will require password rotation every 90 days with basic complexity requirements. This can be done using Azure Security Center.

**II. Data Encryption, Device Hardening, and BYOD:**

NexusTech will enforce data both at rest, and in transit for a minimum of AES-256. Azure Key Vault will be used for key management and weekly offline backups should be stored in secure geo-redundant Azure Backup vaults. Only approved compliant devices will be allowed using Azure Intune and remote wipe will be enforced for BYOD devices containing sensitive company data. 

**III. Employee Cyber Awareness Training:**

NexusTech will provide quarterly training for its employees which educate them on various common social engineering types such as phishing, vishing, and deepfakes. We will test annually for security awareness including newer AI-based threat scenarios to ensure security literacy. 

**IV. Incident Response Plan (IRP):**

We will use key playbooks and frameworks including Microsoft's recommendations to ensure clearly defined response procedures ideally using a tiered escalation model. There will be bi-annual IRP drills which simulate real-world incident scenarios including deepfake impersonation and ransomware. 

**V. Monitoring \& Logging:**

Microsoft Sentinel and/or Splunk will be used for continious monitoring as our primary SIEM tool. We will retain logs for up to 12 months in an achieved storage tier. 

#### B. Successful Policy Implementation Steps

**I. Security Alignment**

NexusTech will present risk assessments and business impact analysis data to the executive board on a rolling basis for effective security mitigation. We will secure a budget and approval for a phased rollout. 

**II. Communication**

NexusTech will announce all policies internally in a timely and purposeful manner. We will deliver role-based cybersecurity training to ensure every member is educated and conduct department specific briefings for any questions and ideas. 

**III. Phased Policy Rollout**

NexusTech will make policies effective in phases following the steps outlined in the 5-Step Key Process for the KTS Cybersecurity Policy in their respective order.

**IV. Audits**

NexusTech will conduct internal audits 60 days after each rollout phase and gather employee feedback and metrics for policy effectiveness. 

#### C. Strategies for Overcoming Potential Challenges

**Engagement:** NexusTech will hold open company Q\&A sessions and used gamified learning platforms such as the "NexusTech Employee Hub" offering employees incentives such as PTO and rewards for challenges completed. We will recognize departments that are excelling in cybersecurity based challenges and hub missions. 

**Budget Limitations:** NexusTech will prioritize Azure-native tools within existing Microsoft agreements and consider low-cost community training resources such as Microsoft Learn and NIST CSF. 

**Technical Barriers and Fatigue:** NexusTech will pilot tools like Microsoft Sentinel with smaller groups before wider implementation and implement policies in phases to ensure more realistic implementation.
